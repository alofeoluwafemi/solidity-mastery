# PiggyFi
Piggy.Fi is a savings protocol that allows savings via Fiat (NGN), which are in turn converted into stable coins via a P2P market and staked on Lending platforms such as Compound &amp; Venus protocol to earn interest. Upon withdrawal of savings as stable coins, it can be converted back to Fiat via a P2P market and sent into the savers account.
