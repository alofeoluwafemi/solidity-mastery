## The Complete Solidity Mastery Course
### Learn how to build dapps using solidity & other tools. In this course you will get to build and deploy a DeFi App

This course is very hands-on, in the sense that you will get to write a lot of code and understand the intricacies of Solidity programming language. The course is accompanied by a few tasks that stretch you a bit so be prepared for that.

I designed this course like what I would have needed to land my first Solidity developer job. You donâ€™t just get to write a contract that simply inserts and fetches data from the blockchain but you will get to build a Defi Saving Dapps the takes ETH as savings from customers and generates interest on savings using Compound Protocol autonomous interest rate.

This course will be making use of Solidity version 0.8.0 for a start and in the future, if there are any major breaking changes, the course will be updated accordingly.

**What should you expect from this course?**

- Learn how all you need to know to start building smart contracts using the solidity programming language including writing tests in javascript.

- Get comfortable building Dapps with tools and technologies such as Infura, Metamask, Ethers.js, Web3, Ganache, Compound Protocol, Truffle, and many others.

- Write an API with Nodejs to interact with the Blockchain and not only through users browser?

- By the end of this course, you will get to build and deploy a Defi Savings Dapps that accept savings in Fait (Local currency, US Dollars ), converts it to Dai Stable coins, and add it to the Compound Supply Market to generate interest in every ethereum block.
